# Graduates Admission Prediction by using a Bayesian approach
During the "Bayesian modeling" course, as part of the final assessment, we were asked to perform a Bayesian analysis putting into practice some of the concepts learned theoretically.

My colleague Leonardo Iania and I have set ourselves the goal of fitting a model as much as possible able to predict the probability that a student will be admitted to a specific master's program. I was very passionate about the project, however it was quite challenging. In addition to the knowledge we learned in the course, we had to read several papers and theoretical book chapters and think about how we could implement this on R  and JAGS.
